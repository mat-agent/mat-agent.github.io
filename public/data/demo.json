In the image, it can be observed that oranges are hanging on a sunlit branch, meaning they are receiving adequate exposure to sunlight, which is essential for photosynthesis and the overall health of the tree. Additionally, it is important for the soil to have proper drainage and the tree to receive enough water to support the growth of the oranges. Proper nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are also vital for the optimal development of the fruits.
